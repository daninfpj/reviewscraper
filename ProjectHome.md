Review Scraper is the ideal app to download App Store reviews on a global scale.

Developers can easily track what people are saying about their apps and see how it ranks in all the App Store countries.

• Search for apps using a familiar interface.

• Translate app reviews into your native language (language support is limited to what the Google Translation API supports).

• Downloaded app reviews are saved and can be easily deleted.

This app was created due to my own need and an effort to learn Obj-C and Interface Builder.

I have no doubt this app and the codebase can be improved ten-fold, please contribute!
