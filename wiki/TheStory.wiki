Review Scraper was written as a personal project so I could scrape reviews for my apps on a global scale.

When the project took off I decided it would be useful for other developers, so intended to sell it for a small cost on the App Store.

Apple had different ideas and it appears Review Scraper breaks one of their rules (Section 3.3.7 of the iPhone SDK Agreement).

Not wanting to stop other developers from using the app I decided to put it up here for others to use and contribute to.

Enjoy!
